# Gistory - Interactive Bash History Search

A fast, interactive replacement for bash's Ctrl+R reverse history search, built with Go and tview.

## Features

- **Fuzzy search**: Type anywhere in the command to find matches
- **Interactive TUI**: Real-time filtering as you type
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys, Vim-style keys (Ctrl+N/Ctrl+P)
- **Deduplication**: Shows only unique commands (most recent first)
- **Fast**: Written in Go for optimal performance

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
go build -o gistory
sudo mv gistory /usr/local/bin/
```

Or install to your local bin:

```bash
go build -o gistory
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv gistory ~/bin/
# Make sure ~/bin is in your PATH
```

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
gistory
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

- **Type**: Filter commands with fuzzy search
- **Enter**: Select current command (prints to stdout)
- **Up/Down** or **Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N**: Navigate through results
- **Esc**: Cancel and exit

## Bash Integration

To replace Ctrl+R with gistory, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Bind Ctrl+R to gistory
bind -x '"\C-r": __gistory'

__gistory() {
    local selected
    selected=$(gistory)
    if [ -n "$selected" ]; then
        READLINE_LINE="$selected"
        READLINE_POINT=${#READLINE_LINE}
    fi
}
```

After adding this, reload your bashrc:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now pressing Ctrl+R will launch gistory instead of the default reverse search!

## How it works

1. Reads commands from `~/.bash_history`
2. Deduplicates commands (keeps most recent)
3. Provides interactive fuzzy search interface
4. Outputs selected command to stdout
5. Bash integration inserts the selected command into your current line

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher (for building)
- Bash with `bind -x` support (most modern versions)
- Terminal with color support
