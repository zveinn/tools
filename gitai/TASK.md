3. your are allowed to use colors when printing
4. keep the printing minimal (one line per activity preferably)

# FUNCTIONALITY NR1 TODO LIST
1. import github sdk for golang
2. create auth token or use API KEY (api key preferred)
3. print a nice list of activities for all open PR's belonging to the user.

Think really hard about this task and if you require github credentials to test, then ask me for them and explain how I can generate them.
